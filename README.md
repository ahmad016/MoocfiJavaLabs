# MoocfiJavaLabs
I will be using this repo to upload some of the labs that I found to be enjoyable/challenging throughout my journey.

## Course: Java Programming
> https://java-programming.mooc.fi/

### Curriculum
Basics of computer programming, along with algorithms and object-oriented programming through the Java programming language

### Structure of Labs Added to Github
Some labs that I have uploaded are only singular files which are located under the `Others` folder. Moving forward, I will be uploading the entire lab directory along with the unit tests provided by mooc.fi to ensure some sort of uniformity.

My code will be located in `[lab name]/src/main/java/[my code here]`
> If the structure is different, please refer to the README inside the lab folder
